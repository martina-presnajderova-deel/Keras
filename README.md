# Keras Demo - Regression/Classification

**What?** Keras is a wrapper on top of Tensorflow and Theano. It is an easy-to-use high-level neural networks API to develop and evaluate deep learning models.

**Why?** Simplifies the process of building deep learning applications


**When?**
Fast experimentation, although TF now has Eager execution - interface where operations are executed immediately as they are called from Python

When would you go deeper then? I.e. use TF rather than high-level Keras?
- flexibility: can tweak more
- functionality
- Threading&Queues
- Debugger: provides visibility into the internal structure and states of running TF graphs
- control: operations on weights, gradients,..
